## Lab 1

The purpose of this lab was to implement a **gradient descent** algorithm for **linear regression** model. 

The dataset used consisted of student midterm and final grades. The correlation between the midterm and final grade were explored. Specifically, the midterm grades 
were used to predict the final grades. 

The follwoing steps where taken to achieve this:

1) Standardization was preformed 

2) A cost function was created

3) A function was created to calculate gradient partial derivatives 

4) A function was created to update m, b, and the learning rate

At the end the results were verified using Sklearn. 

**Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn 


**Software:** VScode, Jupyter Notebook

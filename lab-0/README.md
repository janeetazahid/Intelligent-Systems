## Lab 0

The purpose of this lab was to familiarize yourself with the Python environment, specifically the library scikit-learn. 

In the lab two different algorithms were performed on the **MNIST** dataset. 

The algorithms were: **SVM** and **K-means**.

The confusion matrix for each algorithm was also evaluated.   

**Libraries:** Scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib
